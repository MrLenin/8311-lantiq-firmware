ISSUES
======

* me_alarm_set should set TCA for PM ME

* Add 5-byte counters support to PM

* Remove DLIST and use 'struct list' instead. There is small overhead (lock)
  but it should not be an issue

* Use 'struct list' in MIB instead of directly dealing with ->next

* OMCI handlers (set, get, etc) should use me_data_read/write as much as
  possible to narrow down dealing with the ME handlers (and other 'auto' stuff
  like AVC, etc)

* There may be an issue when we executing MIB reset: GemInterworkingTp
  terminate handler may not find associated GemPortNetworkCtp (suppose it
  will be deleted first) and therefore will not be cleared correctly.
  Solution: store a copy of the GemPortId in the GemPortNetworkCtp or make
  smart MIB resetting mechanism with deletion priority?
  Also need to update all GemInterworkingTp's when the associated 
  GemPortNetworkCtp is changed.
  Another solution is to care about initialize/shutdown seqence of ME classes

* No way to read image data in case of SW simulation because image is
  removed (GPON AL doesn't make anything). Copy image in the GPON AL?

* It seems that there is an issue in the SW DL in case of DL sections lost.
  It's ether OLT or ONT problem, need further clarification.
