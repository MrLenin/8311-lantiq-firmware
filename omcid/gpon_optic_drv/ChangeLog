GPON Optic Driver, NEXT VERSION

v4.5.0 2013.03.08

- GPONSW-1078: Unstable RSSI Mesasurement Results
  + add an additional average on top of the one shot 10 measurements
- GPONSW-1063: Disable P1_Delta and P0/P1 gain calibration by default
  + fixed issues with disabled gain calibration
- GPONSW-1035: Tx disturber sent during initial optic mode switch

v4.4.1 2012.12.12

- GPONSW-1019: Before a reboot, the 1.0 V DC/DC coefficients are set to their hardware 
  default values.
- GPONSW-1031: Debug feature BOSA TX and RX enable was not working.
  Fixed for FALC-ON V1.3 only
- GPONSW-1042: Laser Tx needs to be safely shut off in state O7 (also if BERT is enabled)
  + switch on after leaving O7 (any state)
  + BERT activation no longer switches the laser on
  + Adapted status functions to report the correct tx_enable state (two conditions are now evaluated)

v4.4.0 2012.11.20

- GPONSW-1011: Avoid range check for first collected internal temperature values to
  ensure valid measurement results
- GPONSW-998: automatic power levelling  based on RSSI
  + With the new RSSI_autoleveling feature the internal power level is automatically 
    switched from PL0 to PL1 if a certain upper RSSI threshold power is exceeded,
    and it is switched back to PL0 values, if the measured RSSI power is lower than 
    a lower RSSI threshold power.
- GPONSW-1004: Support of defined biasing below laser threshold in case of low attenuation
  + In case of low attenuation, P0 detection of OLT transceiver is critical. 
    The lower the P0 value the better, some Transceivers do not have Rx Power Squelch 
    and are more susceptible to high P0 levels than others.
  + On the other hand, the additional Jitter with modulating below threshold would be not 
    beneficial for high attenuation, since with high attenuation the detection is 
    noise limited.
  + It is recommended to use this additional Feature especially together with (automatic) Power Leveling
    to increase the overall dynamic range.
- GPONSW-829: fixed APD breakdown voltage calibration reports inaccurate 
  voltage with low probability
  + Updated APD regulation algrithm

- GPONSW-910: bias and drive DAC currents for A22 corrected
- GPONSW-908: Selflearning can be disabled via goi_config parameter
  + In case of a learning threshold configured to be higher than the reset threshold, 
    the optic driver disables self-learning
- GPONSW-898: enable tx path before BERT activation if not already enabled
- GPONSW-868: Provide a function that can enable/disable the transmission 
  + independent of which OMU/BOSA mode is selected
- GPONSW-747: RSSI1490 parabolic correction
