# 8311 Community Firmware MOD -- UCI Configuration
#
# This file is the primary configuration store for the 8311 mod.
# It is read by the LuCI CBI form (model/cbi/8311-config.lua) and by
# the shell scripts in opt/lantiq/bin/ and etc/init.d/.
#
# Identity fields (gpon_sn, ploam_password, omci_loid, omci_lpwd,
# vendor_id, equipment_id, hw_ver) are synced bidirectionally with
# EEPROM-backed firmware env vars by config_onu.sh load/set/init.
# All other options are UCI-only.
#
# Options left unset here will use the defaults defined in the CBI
# model or be treated as empty/disabled by the scripts.
